# Gmail Challenge Response Automation

## Introduction
This Python script automates the process of challenging emails in a Gmail account. It fetches emails with a specific label ("unchallenged"), sends a challenge reply to verify if the sender is human, and upon receiving a positive response ("yes"), it labels the email as "passed" and moves it to the main inbox.

## Features
- **Automated Email Replies**: Automatically sends a challenge question to emails with the "unchallenged" label.
- **Label Management**: Uses Gmail labels to track email status (unchallenged, challenged, passed).
- **Efficient Processing**: Checks and processes emails based on their status without storing any state externally.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Google API Python Client
- Google Auth OAuthlib

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```
git clone https://github.com/castanley/gmail-challenge-automation.git
cd gmail-challenge-automation
```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Unix or MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies**:
```
pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-oauthlib```
```

## Google Cloud Console Configuration:
- Set up a project in the Google Cloud Console.
- Enable the Gmail API.
- Configure the OAuth consent screen.
- Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (type: Desktop App).
